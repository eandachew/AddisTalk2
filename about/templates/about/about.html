    <p class="lead">
        AddisTalk is a community-driven platform created to share ideas,
        stories, and discussions that matter.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project was built using Django as part of a full-stack
        development journey, with a focus on clean design, scalability,
        and real-world functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our goal is to create a space where users can read, comment,
        and engage in meaningful conversations.
